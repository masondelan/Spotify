As part of my final project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Spotify’s "Top 200" and "Viral 50" charts, encompassing global data from January 2019 onward, sourced through the Spotify API. The project aimed to explore the relationship between key musical attributes—such as danceability, acousticness, and loudness—and track popularity, measured through rankings, streaming numbers, and a proprietary popularity metric.

Throughout the project, I employed a range of technical skills, including:
- **Data Wrangling** to manage and clean over 25.2 GB of data
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and trends within the dataset
- **Correlation Analysis & Heat Mapping** to visualize relationships between key musical attributes
- **Data Splitting** for model training and validation
- **Utilization of Recipes, Models, and Workflows** for developing predictive models
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** using grids to optimize model performance

This project allowed me to integrate my expertise in electronic music production  with data analytics, providing valuable insights into how music trends vary across different markets.
